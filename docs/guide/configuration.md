# Configuration

[Documentation home](README.md) · Previous: [Features](features.md) · Next: [CLI](cli.md)

Synapse reads its configuration from the process environment. It does not auto-load a file.
Pass settings with `docker run --env-file`, Compose `env_file`, a strict dotenv loader, or your
process manager. Do not shell-source an untrusted dotenv file: shell syntax in that file would execute.
A fully documented template lives in [`.env.example`](https://github.com/KKloudTarus/synapse-ce/blob/main/.env.example).

Conventions: an empty value means unset, so the built-in default applies. Booleans accept
`1/0/true/false`. Durations use Go syntax such as `30s`, `10m`, `1h`. Sizes are byte counts.

## Reading the enabled set back

`GET /api/v1/capabilities` reports, for every optional subsystem, a stable key, a human name,
whether this deployment enables it, and the `SYNAPSE_*` variable that controls it:

```json
{"capabilities": [
  {"key": "fleet", "name": "Agent fleet transport", "enabled": false, "switch": "SYNAPSE_FLEET_ENABLED"},
  {"key": "cspm", "name": "Cloud security posture management", "enabled": false,
   "switch": "SYNAPSE_CSPM_ENABLED", "requires": ["fleet_assets"]}
]}
```

An optional subsystem registers its routes only when its switch is on, so a disabled subsystem and a
broken one both answer `404`. Read this endpoint first and render a disabled subsystem as disabled.
`requires` names the other capabilities a subsystem depends on, which is why an enabled switch can
still report `enabled: false`. The response carries booleans and variable names, never a configured
value. Any authenticated role may read it.

## Required

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_API_TOKEN` | (none) | Bootstrap-admin bearer token. The API exits if empty. Operational routes require it; liveness `GET /healthz` and readiness `GET /readyz` are intentionally public. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `SYNAPSE_OIDC_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable the browser OIDC BFF. Requires the fixed HTTPS issuer, client credentials, callback URL, fixed frontend URL, fixed tenant, and allowlisted group-to-role mapping below. |
| `SYNAPSE_OIDC_ISSUER` | (none) | Absolute HTTPS issuer used for pinned discovery and ID-token validation. |
| `SYNAPSE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `SYNAPSE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SYNAPSE_OIDC_REDIRECT_URL` | (none) | OAuth client settings. The callback must be the exact registered `https://<api-host>/api/auth/oidc/callback` URL. Never log the secret. |
| `SYNAPSE_OIDC_FRONTEND_URL` | (none) | Fixed absolute HTTPS dashboard URL for a successful callback redirect. Query strings, fragments, and credentials are rejected; request parameters never control this destination. |
| `SYNAPSE_OIDC_TENANT_ID` | (none) | The one fixed Synapse tenant accepted by this BFF instance. |
| `SYNAPSE_OIDC_GROUP_ROLE_MAPPING` | (none) | Comma-separated exact `provider-group=role` entries. Roles may only be `admin`, `consultant`, `reviewer`, or `readonly`; unmapped, duplicate, and multi-role group claims are rejected. |
| `SYNAPSE_OIDC_TRANSACTION_TTL`, `SYNAPSE_OIDC_SESSION_TTL` | `10m`, `8h` | Maximum authorization-transaction and opaque browser-session lifetimes. |

## Core and server

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_HTTP_ADDR` | `:8080` | Listen address. |
| `SYNAPSE_ENV` | `development` | Non-prod values: development, dev, local, test, ci. Any other value is treated as production and enables the strict, fail-closed gates. |
| `SYNAPSE_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log verbosity. |
| `SYNAPSE_SINGLE_TENANT` | `true` | Single-tenant mode. |
| `SYNAPSE_AUP_VERSION` | `1.0` | Acceptable Use Policy version the operator accepts on first run. |
| `SYNAPSE_AUP_FILE` | `data/aup-accepted.json` | File-backed path, in-memory mode only. |
| `SYNAPSE_AUDIT_FILE` | `data/audit.jsonl` | File-backed path, in-memory mode only. |
| `SYNAPSE_MEASURE_CURSOR_SECRET` | Ephemeral in development; required in production | HMAC key for signing Measures pagination cursors; minimum 32 bytes |

## Observability

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_METRICS_ENABLED` | `false` | Expose Prometheus metrics on a SEPARATE listener (`SYNAPSE_METRICS_ADDR`). Off by default; the listener is never bearer-protected and is never itself instrumented. |
| `SYNAPSE_METRICS_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:9090` | Metrics listener address. Loopback-only by default; widen it only onto a private scrape network, never a public interface. |
| `SYNAPSE_ACCESS_LOG_ENABLED` | `true` | Emit one structured `http access` log event per request (method, matched route, status, latency, request id, and (once authenticated) the resolved principal id). Never logs raw paths, query strings, headers, bodies, tenant ids, remote addresses, user agents, or secrets. |

Metric names and label cardinality:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `synapse_http_requests_total` | counter | `method`, `route`, `status_class` | Total HTTP requests. `route` is the matched `net/http` `ServeMux` pattern (e.g. `GET /api/v1/engagements/{id}`), never the raw path, path *values* collapse into one bounded label. An unmatched request reports `route="unmatched"`. `status_class` is `2xx`/`3xx`/`4xx`/`5xx`. |
| `synapse_http_request_duration_seconds` | histogram | `method`, `route`, `status_class` | Request handling latency. |
| `synapse_job_queue_queued` | gauge | none | Aggregate queued durable jobs, across every tenant. Present only when the configured job queue supports aggregate stats (Postgres and in-memory both do). |
| `synapse_job_queue_in_flight` | gauge | none | Aggregate claimed/in-flight durable jobs, across every tenant. |
| `synapse_job_queue_oldest_active_age_seconds` | gauge | none | Age of the oldest still-queued-or-claimed job (`ports.JobStats.OldestActiveAt`), `0` when the queue is empty. |
| `synapse_job_queue_scrape_errors_total` | counter | none | Failed attempts to read aggregate durable job queue stats for a scrape. The three `synapse_job_queue_*` gauges above are omitted from that scrape (never a stale or bogus value) when this increments. |
| `synapse_sca_scan_duration_seconds` | histogram | `outcome` | Completed synchronous or asynchronous SCA execution duration. For an async scan, measured from worker execution start, not from `StartScan`/enqueue time. Queue failures, dead letters, stale sweeps, and blocked gates do not record a duration. |
| `synapse_sca_scan_outcomes_total` | counter | `outcome` | Terminal SCA outcomes: `success`, `failed`, or `blocked`. Queue failures, dead letters, and stale sweeps count as `failed` without a duration. `blocked` is recorded only for an execution-gate denial reached after a genuine scan attempt, never for a pre-gate validation failure. |
| `synapse_finding_lineage_operations_total` | counter | `outcome`, `method`, `reason` | Finding correlation and human-review outcomes. Every label is reduced to a fixed allowlist. |
| `synapse_finding_lineage_backfill_items_total` | counter | `outcome` | Backfill item outcomes: `observation_created`, `provisional_candidate_created`, `skipped`, or `unknown`. |
| `synapse_finding_lineage_backfill_runs_total` | counter | `state` | Backfill terminal states: `completed`, `cancelled`, `failed`, or `unknown`. |
| `synapse_assessment_comparison_operations_total` | counter | `status`, `mode`, `reason` | Comparison generation outcomes with allowlisted status, mode, and reason values. |
| `synapse_assessment_comparison_backlog` | gauge | `tenant_id`, `state` | Per-tenant queued, generating, failed, and dead-lettered Comparison backlog used by rollout gates. |
| `synapse_assessment_comparison_oldest_active_age_seconds` | gauge | `tenant_id` | Age of the oldest queued or generating Comparison for a tenant. |
| `synapse_assessment_comparison_generation_duration_seconds` | histogram | `tenant_id`, `mode`, `status`, `fingerprint_version`, `risk_model_version`, `item_count_band` | Worker generation latency; item counts are reduced to bounded bands. |
| `synapse_assessment_relationship_candidates_total` | counter | `outcome`, `confidence` | Historical relationship candidate generation outcomes. |
| `synapse_assessment_relationship_decisions_total` | counter | `action`, `outcome` | Relationship review decision outcomes. |
| `synapse_assessment_closure_reports_total` | counter | `outcome`, `reason` | Deterministic closure-report generation outcomes with bounded reasons. |

Only the explicitly documented Assessment Comparison rollout series carry `tenant_id`; access logs and every other metric omit tenant, engagement, target, raw path, and free-form error text. All non-tenant label values are fixed allowlists or bounded bands.

Example Prometheus scrape config:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: synapse-api
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["127.0.0.1:9090"]
```

The metrics listener has no authentication of its own. Keep `SYNAPSE_METRICS_ADDR` on loopback or a private network reachable only by your scrape infrastructure; do not put it behind the same reverse-proxy path as the bearer-protected API, and do not widen it to a public interface. Startup logs a WARN if `SYNAPSE_METRICS_ENABLED` is set and `SYNAPSE_METRICS_ADDR` does not resolve to a loopback address.

## Persistence

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_DB_DSN` | (in-memory) | Runtime PostgreSQL connection URL. Empty runs an in-memory dev store, so nothing is durable. |
| `SYNAPSE_DB_MIGRATION_DSN` | `SYNAPSE_DB_DSN` in development | Optional owner-level PostgreSQL DSN used only by `synapse-migrate`, separating migration authority from the least-privileged runtime DSN. In production it must use a database user distinct from the runtime DSN. |
| `SYNAPSE_DB_HALT_WRITER_DSN` | (none) | PostgreSQL DSN for the dedicated response halt-writer role. Required with PostgreSQL-backed live response execution; its database user must differ from both migration and ordinary runtime users. Expose it only to the API, and grant only the fence, dispatch, and response-audit-intent privileges provisioned by `synapse-migrate`. |
| `SYNAPSE_DB_AUTO_MIGRATE` | `true` in development | Long-running services apply embedded migrations only in development. Production requires `false`; run `synapse-migrate` first. Use backward-compatible, phased, migrate-first changes: the API accepts only an applied forward migration strictly above its embedded maximum and exposes a stale or divergent schema through `/readyz`; worker and MCP refuse startup until the schema is current because they have no readiness endpoint. |
| `SYNAPSE_DB_MAX_CONNS` | `32` | pgx pool maximum connections. |
| `SYNAPSE_DB_MIN_CONNS` | `0` | pgx pool minimum connections. |
| `SYNAPSE_DB_MAX_CONN_LIFETIME` | `1h` | Connection lifetime. |
| `SYNAPSE_DB_MAX_CONN_IDLE` | `30m` | Idle connection timeout. |

## Shared artifact store (S3 or MinIO)

When S3/MinIO is configured, the same object store retains evidence artifacts and Engagement source
packages uploaded from the UI. Uploaded packages accept non-empty `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, and `.tgz`
files up to 512 MiB compressed. API and worker processes must use the same endpoint and bucket.
Without an endpoint, evidence uses the non-durable development store, but uploaded source uses a
persistent filesystem root. Durable source metadata also requires PostgreSQL; an in-memory database
is not a restart-safe deployment even when archive files are retained.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_BLOB_ENDPOINT` | (none) | Host and port without a scheme. Empty uses in-memory evidence storage and filesystem storage for uploaded Engagement source. |
| `SYNAPSE_BLOB_ACCESS_KEY` | (none) | Object-store access key; provide through the deployment's secret-management mechanism. |
| `SYNAPSE_BLOB_SECRET_KEY` | (none) | Object-store secret key; never commit it to configuration or logs. |
| `SYNAPSE_BLOB_BUCKET` | `synapse-evidence` | Shared bucket for evidence artifacts and uploaded Engagement source packages. |
| `SYNAPSE_BLOB_USE_SSL` | `false` | Set true for HTTPS endpoints; use TLS for production object-store traffic. |
| `SYNAPSE_ENGAGEMENT_SOURCE_DIR` | OS user configuration directory + `synapse/engagement-sources` | Durable operator-owned source archive root when the blob endpoint is empty. Must be an absolute, non-root real directory, not a symlink. API and workers must use the same persistent volume and root; keep it outside scanned repositories and temporary workspaces. |

The filesystem adapter creates private directories/files and refuses unsafe roots or invalid object
paths. Do not treat this root as a disposable cache. Separate containers or hosts do not share their
default user configuration directories: mount the same retained volume and configure the path in each
process, or use S3/MinIO. Back up PostgreSQL and source objects consistently. Changing an existing
filesystem root or bucket does not migrate retained objects. Source reuse verifies the actual bytes;
metadata or SHA-256 alone cannot restore a missing archive. See the
[uploaded-source lifecycle](assessment-lifecycle-operations.md#uploaded-source-lifecycle) for immutable
versions, Re-test choices, legacy limitations and migrations `0159`/`0160`.

## Restore verification (synapse-verify-restore)

`synapse-verify-restore` is a read-only recovery tool. It reuses `SYNAPSE_DB_DSN` and the evidence
blob-store settings above, and requires a database identity permitted to read every tenant's
evidence chain; a least-privilege runtime role fails closed rather than reporting an empty restore
as intact.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_RESTORE_VERIFY_TIMEOUT` | `2m` | Maximum duration for one restore-verification run before it fails. |
| `SYNAPSE_RESTORE_VERIFY_EXPECTED_STATE` | (none) | Path to an independently captured expected-state manifest (audit head, per-engagement evidence heads and counts, expected applied migration versions). Equivalent to `--expected-state`. Without it a run reports `completeness: incomplete_no_expected_state`, because an emptied database cannot be distinguished from an intact one. |

## Custody, signing, and anchoring (required in production)

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_VAULT_MASTER_KEY` | (ephemeral) | AES-256 credential-vault master key, 64 hex chars or base64 of 32 bytes. Empty uses an ephemeral dev key, so stored secrets do not survive a restart. Never logged. |
| `SYNAPSE_EVIDENCE_SIGNING_SEED` | (ephemeral) | ed25519 seed attesting evidence and audit chain heads. Never logged. |
| `SYNAPSE_TSA_URL` | (none) | RFC-3161 timestamp authority for external anchoring. Empty leaves the chain signed but not anchored, still tamper-evident. |

## Software composition analysis

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_SBOM_PRODUCER` | `ownsbom` | `ownsbom` (default; detection-independent owned parsers across 23 ecosystems with dep-graph edges, so no third-party scanner binary is required) or `syft` (the pinned Syft binary, an opt-in cross-check). Set `syft` to roll back. |
| `SYNAPSE_SYFT_BIN` | `syft` | Syft executable, resolved on PATH. |
| `SYNAPSE_GRYPE_BIN` | `grype` | Grype executable. Missing means detection degrades to the live source only. |
| `SYNAPSE_GRYPE_DB_DIR` | (online) | Pin Grype's vulnerability database to a pre-synced directory for offline, reproducible scans. |
| `SYNAPSE_DETECTION_SOURCES` | (owned default) | Comma list selecting and ordering the vulnerability detection sources from `grype`, `osv`, `advisory-store` (Synapse's own advisory corpus). Empty selects the owned-only default: `osv` unless offline, then `advisory-store` when `SYNAPSE_OWNED_ADVISORY` (the default), with Grype dropped to an opt-in cross-check. Dropping Grype does not silently lower OS-package recall: the OS-distro coverage guard marks a scan not-confident when an OS-package's distro is not covered by the owned store and Grype is absent. When set it is authoritative, so an operator restores Grype with `osv,grype,advisory-store`. Unknown names fail closed at startup. |
| `SYNAPSE_STRICT_SOURCES` | `false` | Fail closed on a detection-source error. Default degrades: a source that errors (a transient OSV.dev outage, an advisory-store read blip) is skipped with a warning and the remaining sources still run, matching how Grype self-degrades when its binary or database is absent. |
| `SYNAPSE_SCAN_TIMEOUT` | `10m` | Per-scan timeout. 0 disables. |
| `SYNAPSE_FINDING_MIN_SEVERITY` | `info` | Lowest severity promoted to a finding: critical, high, medium, low, info. The default promotes everything; set `high` to tighten the floor and drop medium/low/info. |
| `SYNAPSE_MAX_WORKSPACE_BYTES` | `2147483648` | Maximum prepared workspace size. A bigger target or archive is rejected. |
| `SYNAPSE_OWNED_ADVISORY` | `true` | Match the SBOM against the owned advisory store, the default primary vulnerability source. Populate it first with `synapse-cli sync-advisories`; an empty store yields no findings, so a deployment that has not synced advisories should keep `osv`/`grype` in `SYNAPSE_DETECTION_SOURCES`. |
| `SYNAPSE_SYMBOL_OVERLAY_DIR` | (none) | Directory of curated advisory-id -> affected-symbol JSON files; the owned matcher merges these onto findings so non-Go / NVD-CSAF-only advisories can drive symbol reachability. Best-effort. |
| `SYNAPSE_JARHASH_ONLINE_ENABLED` | `false` | Recover the coordinate of a shaded or metadata-less JAR by its SHA-1. |
| `SYNAPSE_OSV_URL`, `SYNAPSE_OSV_BULK_URL`, `SYNAPSE_DEPSDEV_URL`, `SYNAPSE_KEV_URL`, `SYNAPSE_EPSS_URL` | (public) | Feed overrides for tests or mirrors. |
| `SYNAPSE_ALPINE_SECDB_URL` | `https://secdb.alpinelinux.org` | Base URL `sync-advisories --remote-secdb` ingests Alpine's apk advisories from. Point it at an internal mirror of the same layout for an air-gapped estate. |

### Owned-only scanner default and rollback

The shipped default is the owned engine end to end, so a production deployment needs no third-party scanner binary:

- **SBOM producer:** `SYNAPSE_SBOM_PRODUCER=ownsbom` produces the SBOM with Synapse's own per-ecosystem parsers (23 ecosystems, dependency-graph edges). Syft is retained as an opt-in cross-check. The producer flip was gated on the owned engine meeting the independent oracle and pinned-competitor floors (`internal/usecase/scabench`) and Syft dependency-graph parity (`internal/infrastructure/tools/ownsbom`).
- **Detection sources:** live OSV (unless offline) plus the owned `advisory-store`, with Grype dropped to an opt-in cross-check. Offline, the default is the owned advisory store alone.

Dropping Grype does not silently lower OS-package recall. The OS-distro coverage guard marks a scan not-confident (and, under `SYNAPSE_STRICT_SOURCES`, aborts) when an OS-package's distro ecosystem is not covered by the owned advisory store and Grype is not in the detection set, so an unsynced distro feed surfaces as a gap rather than a false clean posture.

Before relying on the owned-only posture for OS packages, run `synapse-cli sync-advisories --remote-distros`, configure authenticated API-managed OVAL sources with a pinned OpenPGP key or trusted provider metadata, and sync any required CSAF sources. The only non-OpenPGP OVAL exception is `suse_https_origin=true` on the exact SLES 15 SP6 compressed SUSE artifact documented in [Vulnerability intelligence](vulnerability-intelligence.md#source-management); it is HTTPS-origin trust, not signature verification, and is neither a generic SUSE nor unsigned-feed option. Unbounded RPM evidence from CSAF requires `sync_mode=full`, configured trust, and `authoritative_snapshot=true`; ordinary CSAF suppresses it. The current Red Hat directory/archive/update distribution is not an automatically supported authoritative source. `sync-advisories --oval` rejects unsigned local OVAL rather than persisting it. Use `synapse-cli sync-advisories` for app-ecosystem advisories.

To roll back to the previous Syft plus Grype behavior, set both:

```bash
export SYNAPSE_SBOM_PRODUCER=syft
export SYNAPSE_DETECTION_SOURCES=osv,grype,advisory-store
```

The producer rollback is exercised by `TestLoadSBOMProducer`, and the detection rollback by the `rollback: explicit list restores grype` case in `TestResolveDetectionSourceNames`.

## Extra scanners and detection tuning (opt-in)

Most of these ship ON by default (safe, best-effort). See [Features](features.md) for what each one does.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_SECRET_SCAN_ENABLED` | `true` | Secret scanning over the workspace (regex plus entropy). Matches are redacted; the raw secret never reaches logs, evidence, or the report. |
| `SYNAPSE_SECRET_HISTORY_ENABLED` | `false` | Also scan git history (every blob reachable from all refs) for a secret committed then removed. Best-effort on a git repository; matches redacted. |
| `SYNAPSE_SECRET_VERIFY_ENABLED` | `false` | Opt-in active verification for GitHub, GitLab, OpenAI, AWS, and Vault credentials. SECURITY-SENSITIVE: it sends raw detected material over the network to the issuing provider, so enable it only for an authorized assessment. AWS is checked only when a unique nearby access-key/secret-key pair (and an `ASIA` session token) can be correlated; ambiguous/incomplete pairs make no request. Requests use SSRF-hardened, rate-limited clients with no proxy or redirects, raw values are never logged/sealed/reported, and at most 100 distinct credentials are checked per scan. A verified credential raises confidence; unknown/unverified never suppresses the finding. `--offline` disables verification. |
| `SYNAPSE_SECRET_VERIFY_RPS` | `5` | Cap on the secret verifier's outbound provider requests per second. Only meaningful when `SYNAPSE_SECRET_VERIFY_ENABLED` is `true`. |
| `SYNAPSE_SECRET_VERIFY_VAULT_ADDR` | (none) | Optional absolute HTTPS Vault base address. Required only for Vault-token verification. Private RFC1918 addresses are permitted, while loopback, link-local, multicast, redirects, and ambient proxies remain blocked. |
| `SYNAPSE_MISCONFIG_ENABLED` | `true` | Misconfiguration and IaC scanning of Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests. |
| `SYNAPSE_CSPM_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable durable read-only cloud posture runs. Requires PostgreSQL, fleet assets, `synapse-worker`, sandbox, and kernel egress enforcement. |
| `SYNAPSE_CSPM_PROVIDERS` | empty | Comma-separated provider allowlist: `aws`, `azure`, `gcp`. |
| `SYNAPSE_CSPM_RATE` | `0` | Requests per second, `1..100`; `0` selects provider defaults. |
| `SYNAPSE_CSPM_HELPER_BIN` | `synapse-cspm` | CSPM requires this to be an absolute path and authoritatively pinned in `SYNAPSE_TOOL_HASHES`; the helper executes inside bubblewrap. |
| `SYNAPSE_CSPM_EGRESS_HOSTS` | empty | Comma-separated `provider=hostname` HTTPS allowlist. Empty fails CSPM startup closed. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable advisory LLM false-positive analysis over production-scope SAST/misconfig findings. Secrets never enter the LLM. A proposer alone or a scan without an evidence ledger never changes a gate. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_MODEL` | `SYNAPSE_LLM_MODEL` | Proposer model for false-positive analysis. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_PROVIDER` | `SYNAPSE_LLM_PROVIDER` | Explicit provider identity for the triage proposer model. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_MODE` | `shadow` | `shadow` records `would_gate_exempt` but always keeps the finding gating. `enforce` permits the verified-consensus policy to set `gate_exempt`. Empty or unknown values fail closed to shadow. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_MAX_FINDINGS` | `100` | Hard per-scan cap on eligible findings sent to AI triage (range `1..1000`). When capped, deterministic policy-impact/severity/risk ordering selects work; skipped findings remain reported and gating, and counts are exposed in `ai_triage_budget`. Invalid values restore the finite default. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_CONCURRENCY` | `6` | Maximum simultaneous AI finding assessments (range `1..32`). A distinct verifier makes at most two provider calls per attempted finding. Invalid values restore the finite default. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_MAX_TOKENS` | `1000000` | Conservative per-scan token reservation ceiling. Both proposer/verifier requests are reserved before a finding is scheduled; work that does not fit remains gating. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_MAX_COST_MICRO_USD` | `0` | Optional per-scan cost ceiling in integer micro-USD (`0` disables cost enforcement). When enabled, all active role prices must be configured or triage fails closed without provider calls. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_PROPOSER_INPUT_MICRO_USD_PER_MILLION` | `0` | Proposer input price in micro-USD per million tokens, for deterministic cost reservation and observed-cost metrics. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_PROPOSER_OUTPUT_MICRO_USD_PER_MILLION` | `0` | Proposer output price in micro-USD per million tokens. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_VERIFIER_INPUT_MICRO_USD_PER_MILLION` | `0` | Verifier input price in micro-USD per million tokens. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_VERIFIER_OUTPUT_MICRO_USD_PER_MILLION` | `0` | Verifier output price in micro-USD per million tokens. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_CIRCUIT_FAILURES` | `5` | Consecutive provider/parse failures before that role's circuit opens (range `1..100`). An open circuit is advisory-only and cannot exempt findings. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_CIRCUIT_COOLDOWN` | `1m` | Open-circuit cooldown before one half-open probe (maximum `24h`). |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_ALERT_MIN_SAMPLES` | `10` | Minimum per-scan samples before a safety-rate baseline alert is emitted. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_DISAGREEMENT_BASELINE_BPS` | `1500` | Expected proposer/verifier disagreement rate in basis points (`10000` = 100%). |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_EXEMPTION_BASELINE_BPS` | `1000` | Expected gate-exemption rate in basis points. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_PARSE_FAILURE_BASELINE_BPS` | `200` | Expected model parse-failure rate in basis points. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_ALERT_DEVIATION_BPS` | `1000` | Absolute deviation from a configured baseline that emits a persisted warning and structured alert metric. |
| `SYNAPSE_LLM_PROVIDER` | `openai-compatible` | Explicit proposer-provider audit identity. It is not inferred from the URL because gateways may route multiple providers. |
| `SYNAPSE_VERIFIER_BASE_URL` | `SYNAPSE_LLM_BASE_URL` | Independent OpenAI-compatible endpoint for the verifier. |
| `SYNAPSE_VERIFIER_API_KEY` | `SYNAPSE_LLM_API_KEY` | Independent verifier credential; never logged. |
| `SYNAPSE_VERIFIER_PROVIDER` | `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_PROVIDER` | Explicit verifier-provider audit identity. It defaults to the proposer identity so provider independence remains advisory-only until an operator deliberately selects a different verifier provider. |
| `SYNAPSE_VERIFIER_MODEL` | `SYNAPSE_LLM_MODEL` | Must name a different canonical model family for AI gate exemptions. The verifier is blind to the proposer result. Provider/date aliases and Amazon Bedrock inference-profile IDs fail closed as the same family. Two-model consensus remains subject to high/critical, secret, and dangerous-CWE human-review floors. |
| `SYNAPSE_FP_TRIAGE_INDEPENDENCE` | `model_family` | `model_family` requires different canonical model families. `provider` additionally requires different non-empty provider identities. Empty defaults to model-family compatibility; unknown values fail closed to advisory-only. |
| `SYNAPSE_DETECTION_PRIORITY` | `comprehensive` | `comprehensive` reports every match. `precise` quarantines single-source, non-KEV findings into a needs-verify queue that is still reported and sealed but exempt from the `--fail-on` gate. |
| `SYNAPSE_OFFLINE` | `false` | Run `synapse-cli scan` without network egress: detect with the local sources only (the owned advisory store, plus Grype's pre-synced database when `SYNAPSE_DETECTION_SOURCES` lists it), and switch off live OSV, every registry resolver (npm, composer, poetry, Bundler, Maven, Gradle), the Maven Central JAR SHA-1 lookup, KEV/EPSS, online NVD CVSS backfill, deps.dev and PyPI license metadata, and AI false-positive triage. Same as `--offline`. |
| `SYNAPSE_IGNORE_UNFIXED` | `false` | Drop vulnerabilities that have no fixed version. |
| `SYNAPSE_DB_MAX_AGE_DAYS` | `30` | Warn when a dated reference database (KEV, EPSS, or the Grype DB) is older than this many days. 0 disables the check. |
| `SYNAPSE_SUPPRESSION_ENABLED` | `true` | Honor a `.synapseignore` file. Acceptance exempts only the `--fail-on` gate; the finding is still reported, persisted, and evidence-sealed. |
| `SYNAPSE_VEX_ENABLED` | `true` | Consume an in-repo OpenVEX document (`.synapse.vex.json`) at scan time, on the same retain-and-mark surface as suppression. |
| `SYNAPSE_COMPLIANCE_ENABLED` | `true` | Compliance benchmark. Re-projects findings onto a control specification and reports per-control PASS or FAIL. |
| `SYNAPSE_SCAN_CACHE_ENABLED` | `true` | Enables content-addressed scan caches. SBOM entries key on content plus producer version. Tenant-bound API AI-triage entries key on tenant, project/engagement scope, finding fingerprint, complete-source hash, prompt-context hash, proposer/verifier models, prompt version, and policy version. Cached AI claims are always rebound to the current finding, re-authorized by server policy, and linked to newly sealed scan evidence; missing tenant identity and provider failures are not cached. The directory must be operator-owned, since a shared-writable cache would allow poisoning. |
| `SYNAPSE_SCAN_CACHE_DIR` | (per-user) | Cache location. Empty uses a per-user cache directory; AI-triage entries live in its owner-only `ai-triage` subdirectory and contain typed claims, never source text or credentials. |
| `SYNAPSE_IMAGE_ROOTFS_ENABLED` | `true` | Materialize a container image root filesystem so the owned OS-package catalogers (dpkg, apk, and the rpm sqlite database) and installed-binary catalogers (Go build info, Python dist-info) can run. Best-effort. |

## Project Code artifact retention and historical comparisons

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_PROJECT_SOURCE_ARTIFACT_DIR` | `data/project-source-artifacts` | Operator-owned local storage for immutable, gzip-compressed Project Code head/base artifacts. Restrict OS access, encrypt/back up it according to source-data policy, and do not place it on a shared writable volume. The full Compose stack mounts its dedicated `project-source-artifacts` named volume here. |
| `SYNAPSE_PROJECT_SOURCE_RETENTION` | `2160h` (90 days) | How long captured analysis artifacts remain available. Startup cleanup removes expired analysis directories; project deletion removes all of that project's artifacts. Legacy analyses are never backfilled. |
| `SYNAPSE_PROJECT_ANALYSIS_SHORTLIVED_KEEP` | `20` | How many of the newest analyses to keep on a short-lived (feature/pull-request) branch. After a new analysis is recorded on such a branch, older ones beyond this count are pruned. Long-lived branches (main/develop, release lines, the project default) are retained in full. Set `0` to disable pruning and keep all history. |
| `SYNAPSE_PROJECT_SOURCE_MAX_FILE_BYTES` | `2097152` | Maximum captured source file size. Bigger files are retained as unavailable metadata. |
| `SYNAPSE_PROJECT_SOURCE_MAX_FILES` | `10000` | Maximum source files captured for one analysis. |
| `SYNAPSE_PROJECT_SOURCE_MAX_BYTES` | `524288000` | Total source-artifact capture budget per analysis. |
| `SYNAPSE_MAVEN_POM_CACHE` | OS cache dir | Where fetched Maven POMs are kept so a second scan of the same project needs no network. The layout is a standard Maven repository layout, so an existing mirror can be pointed at directly. An unwritable directory disables caching without disabling fetching. |
| `SYNAPSE_MAVEN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_REPOS` | `false` | Allow a `<repositories>` entry that resolves to a private address (RFC 1918) to be fetched from. Off by default because a `pom.xml` is untrusted input and a scanner must not be steered into the network it runs inside; turn it on to resolve your own project against your own internal repository. Loopback and link-local (cloud instance metadata) are refused even when this is on. |
| `SYNAPSE_SAST_SOURCE_BUDGET_BYTES` | `0` (built-in 64 MiB) | Source bytes the pattern SAST analyzer retains for cross-file context analysis. The default bounds memory on an untrusted tree and never binds on an ordinary repository, but it does bind on a monorepo: a tree holding 164 MiB of source against a 64 MiB budget leaves most of itself unretained, and no rule runs over the part that was not held. The scan reports the number of files in that state, so raising this is a memory-for-coverage trade an operator makes deliberately. `0` keeps the built-in default. |
| `SYNAPSE_PROJECT_GIT_COMPARISON_DEPTH` | `256` | Maximum Git history depth acquired for persisted comparisons and behavioral-hotspot evidence. Behavioral hotspots evaluate at most `depth - 1` first-parent commits (capped at 2048), never fetch during analysis, and report shallow/incomplete history explicitly; a missing/too-old comparison base leaves source readable but comparison/unified/split capabilities unavailable. |

Historical Code reads are analysis-scoped and private-cacheable. Source and diff APIs never fetch the current repository or read mutable local paths. Git comparison requires configured, validated head/base/default-branch refs; local and archive scans intentionally expose source-only capability. Generated files are hidden by default from the Code inventory but remain retained and explicitly addressable. Binary/non-UTF-8/limited artifacts expose an unavailable reason instead of content.

For `docker run`, mount durable storage at the image's configured artifact path (the API image uses `/project-source-artifacts`): `--mount type=volume,source=synapse-project-source-artifacts,target=/project-source-artifacts`. Removing that volume permanently removes retained historical Code source and diffs.

## Fleet attack paths

Attack paths are available when `SYNAPSE_FLEET_ASSETS_ENABLED=true`. They correlate the tenant's
asset relationships with explicitly attributed findings and reachability judgments. Every response
reports whether traversal was truncated; lowering a bound never produces a result that looks complete.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_ATTACKPATH_MAX_LEN` | `12` | Maximum number of steps in one path. Must be positive. |
| `SYNAPSE_ATTACKPATH_MAX_PATHS` | `100` | Maximum retained paths per requested target or finding. Must be positive. |
| `SYNAPSE_ATTACKPATH_WALLCLOCK` | `2s` | Wall-clock traversal budget. Must be positive. |

## Reachability tiers (opt-in per language)

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_REACHABILITY_ENABLED` | `true` | Go Tier-2 call-graph reachability proof (best-effort). |
| `SYNAPSE_REACHABILITY_BUILDER` | `owned` | Go Tier-2 call-graph producer: `owned` (Synapse's own go/ssa builder, no third-party engine) or `govulncheck`. |
| `SYNAPSE_JVM_REACHABILITY_ENABLED` | `false` | Opts in to JVM Tier-2 bytecode reachability analysis for target artifacts. |
| `SYNAPSE_JVM_REACH_TIER2_POINTS_TO_ENABLED` | `false` | Optional JVM Tier-2 receiver points-to refinement. When enabled, applies bounded intraprocedural Andersen-style narrowing and falls back to CHA whenever receiver facts are incomplete. Raise-only: it can increase urgency but never emits `not_affected`. Requires JVM reachability and judgments. |
| `SYNAPSE_PYREACH_ENABLED` | `true` | Python Tier-1 import-reachability: a declared DIRECT dependency never imported by first-party source becomes an OpenVEX `not_affected` (transitive deps are refused, not answered). Default ON; fails to unknown on any coverage gap. Needs judgments. |
| `SYNAPSE_PYREACH_TIER2_ENABLED` | `false` | Python Tier-2 affected-symbol semantic reachability. Requires Tier-1, judgments, and a CGO-enabled `synapse-ast`. |
| `SYNAPSE_PYTAINT_ENABLED` | `true` | Python interprocedural semantic taint proposals (default-on when the synapse-ast sidecar resolves; a clean no-op otherwise). Requires judgments and a CGO-enabled `synapse-ast`; it does not require the target-compilation sandbox. |
| `SYNAPSE_JSTAINT_ENABLED` | `false` | JavaScript/TypeScript interprocedural semantic taint proposals. OFF by default while the catalog breadth grows. Requires judgments and a CGO-enabled `synapse-ast`; source-only, so the target-compilation sandbox is not required. |
| `SYNAPSE_JAVATAINT_ENABLED` | `false` | Java interprocedural semantic taint proposals (Spring/Servlet/JDBC). OFF by default while the catalog breadth grows. Requires judgments and a CGO-enabled `synapse-ast`; source-only, so the target-compilation sandbox is not required. |
| `SYNAPSE_TRISCORE_REASSESS_ENABLED` | `false` | Tri-score risk reassessment surface (`POST /api/v1/fleet/incidents/{id}/risk/reassess`): re-scores an incident's RiskAssessment via the deterministic Scorer. Threat is live; Exposure/Behavior/Coverage abstain until their producers are wired. |
| `SYNAPSE_AST_BIN` | bundled / `PATH` | Optional path to the `synapse-ast` sidecar used by Python Tier-2 reachability, Python taint, and code-quality analysis. |
| `SYNAPSE_JSREACH_ENABLED` | `true` | JS/TS Tier-1 import-level reachability. Default ON; fails to unknown on any coverage gap. Needs judgments. |
| `SYNAPSE_JSREACH_TIER2_ENABLED` | `false` | JS/TS Tier-2 affected-export reachability. When Tier-1 is on, Tier-2 runs by default in raise-only mode (mints only reachable/urgency-raising judgments, never suppresses). Setting this to `true` additionally mints not-reachable (suppressing → OpenVEX not_affected) judgments, which the lexical scanner can only assert conservatively. |
| `SYNAPSE_JSREACH_INTERPROC_TIER2_ENABLED` | `false` | Suppressing direction of the interprocedural JS/TS Tier-2 call graph. The interprocedural recorder is raise-only by default (it proves a reached affected export via first-party wrappers). Setting this to `true` lets it also mint not-reachable (suppressing → OpenVEX not_affected) for an affected export proven unreached, but only on a COMPLETE resolver graph (any dynamic construct or escaping callable taints every negative) with entry points present. A wrong negative would hide a real vulnerability, so this stays off by default. |

## Fleet, leader election, and DAST

All off by default. The fleet needs PostgreSQL + `synapse-worker`; agents run on Linux hosts / Kubernetes. Enable leader election when running more than one API/worker so scheduled work fires once.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_ENABLED` | `false` | Fleet transport + agent-admin routes. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_ASSETS_ENABLED` | `false` | Fleet asset model + attack paths. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_HOST_INGEST_ENABLED` | `false` | Accept host-inventory from `synapse-agent`. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CLUSTER_INGEST_ENABLED` | `false` | Accept Kubernetes inventory from `synapse-cluster-agent`. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_TELEMETRY_INGEST_ENABLED` | `false` | Accept signed agent telemetry batches (A3, `POST /api/v1/fleet/telemetry`); verified + idempotently sequenced server-side. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_DETECTION_INGEST_ENABLED` | `false` | Accept signed agent detection batches (A4, `POST /api/v1/fleet/detections`); sealed once into the evidence chain. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_DETECTION_RECONCILE_INTERVAL` | `1m` | How often the tenant-scoped reconciler repairs pending attributed detections. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CORRELATION_ENABLED` | `false` | Correlation orchestration: folds an engagement's sealed detections into incidents, auto-scoring each when tri-score is enabled. Runs on every detection batch that seals new detections, and on demand through `POST /api/v1/fleet/engagements/{id}/correlate`. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CORRELATION_WINDOW` | `30m` | Session gap for correlation, detections on one (asset, host) more than this apart start a new incident. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CORRELATION_ALLOWED_LATENESS` | `5m` | Delay between maximum observed event time and the monotonic watermark. A newly seen detection behind the previous watermark is isolated with a visible coverage note rather than silently rewriting a finalized session. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CORRELATION_MAX_PER_INCIDENT` | `100` | Cap on detections one incident reflects individually before a storm is suppressed to a single note. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CORRELATION_PAGE_SIZE` | `100` | Source materialization and staged consumption rows per bounded invocation (1–1000). |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CORRELATION_MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS` | `500` | Maximum active session summaries loaded into one correlation transaction (1–10000). |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CORRELATION_MAX_TIMELINE_REFS_PER_DETECTION` | `32` | Maximum causal timeline references fetched for one detection (1–1000). |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CORRELATION_MAX_TIMELINE_REFS_PER_PAGE` | `500` | Maximum causal timeline references fetched by one materialization page; at least the per-detection cap (1–10000). |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_KEY_REGISTRATION_ENABLED` | `false` | Serve agent signing-key registration (`POST /api/v1/fleet/keys`) + operator key list/revoke (A4, A0.2). |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_STALE_AFTER` | `10m` | An agent older than this reads as stale (`<=0` disables the staleness view). |
| `SYNAPSE_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` | (unset) | Enables operator alerting: each incident correlation opens is posted as signed JSON to this URL. `https` required, `http` only for a loopback host. `POST /api/v1/alerts/test` sends a test alert. |
| `SYNAPSE_ALERT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | (unset) | Signs each webhook body: `X-Synapse-Signature: sha256=<hex HMAC-SHA256 of "<X-Synapse-Timestamp>.<body>">`. At least 16 bytes when set. |
| `SYNAPSE_ALERT_MIN_SEVERITY` | `medium` | Inclusive severity floor for delivered alerts (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`). Test alerts always deliver. |
| `SYNAPSE_ALERT_WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE` | `false` | Let the webhook client dial private-use receivers (RFC 1918 and IPv6 unique-local). The SSRF guard refuses them otherwise. Loopback, link-local, cloud metadata (including `fd00:ec2::/32`) and other special-purpose addresses stay refused either way. |
| `SYNAPSE_ALERT_WEBHOOK_ALLOW_UNSIGNED` | `false` | Allow UNSIGNED alert delivery when no secret is set. Default false: a configured webhook requires `SYNAPSE_ALERT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` so a receiver can trust the alert is genuine. Set true only for a development receiver that does not verify the signature. |
| `SYNAPSE_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable tenant-managed Webhook, Slack, and Email channels, durable rule fan-out, delivery history, and the worker source scheduler. Requires PostgreSQL, a running `synapse-worker`, and a stable shared `SYNAPSE_VAULT_MASTER_KEY`. |
| `SYNAPSE_OWNERSHIP_MODE` | `off` | Finding ownership rollout: `off`, `observe`, or `enforce`; invalid values stop startup. Enabled modes require PostgreSQL. The API admits durable preview/reroute runs and `synapse-worker` captures scan provenance, dispatches dirty findings, and consumes routing jobs. `observe` evaluates without automatic assignment; `enforce` enables automatic assignment and release-to-auto. Memory mode reports `postgres_required`. See [ownership API](https://github.com/KKloudTarus/synapse-ce/blob/main/docs/ownership-api.md). |
| `SYNAPSE_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_HOST` | (unset) | Operator-managed SMTP relay host used by every tenant Email channel. Tenants can select recipients but cannot select the relay. The relay is dialed through the same SSRF guard as HTTP deliveries with the operator policy: loopback and private addresses are allowed for a local or internal MTA, and cloud metadata and link-local addresses are refused with `smtp_destination_blocked`. |
| `SYNAPSE_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PORT` | `587` | SMTP relay port. |
| `SYNAPSE_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_FROM` | (unset) | Envelope and message sender for notification email. Required before an Email channel can deliver. |
| `SYNAPSE_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_USERNAME` / `SYNAPSE_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PASSWORD` | (unset) | Optional SMTP authentication. The password is secret and must not be logged. |
| `SYNAPSE_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_REQUIRE_TLS` | `true` | Require STARTTLS with certificate verification. Keep enabled in production. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_COVERAGE_FRESHNESS_TARGET` | `24h` | Coverage freshness SLO. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_MIN_AGENT_VERSION` | empty | Reject agents below this version (empty = no floor). |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_ENROL_URL` | `SYNAPSE_FLEET_URL` | One-time enrollment API base URL for `synapse-agent`; after enrollment, the agent uses `SYNAPSE_FLEET_URL`. HTTPS is required except for a loopback host. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CA_CERT` / `_CA_KEY` / `_CERT_TTL` | empty | Enrolment PKI for agent client certificates (never logged). |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_SIGNER_KEY` | empty | Signing key for agent packages/updates (never logged). |
| `SYNAPSE_RESPONSE_EXECUTION_ENABLED` | `false` | Opt in to live governed response. The API requires fleet transport, assets, host ingest, telemetry ingest, key registration, and the command-signing key. An endpoint agent additionally requires process detection and a pinned command trust bundle. |
| `SYNAPSE_RESPONSE_COMMAND_SIGNING_KEY_FILE` | empty | API-only owner-readable Ed25519 response-command private-key document. Never mount it into an endpoint agent. |
| `SYNAPSE_RESPONSE_COMMAND_TRUST_FILE` | empty | Agent-only owner-readable bundle of pinned response-command public keys. Unknown, expired, revoked, or incorrectly purposed keys fail closed. |
| `SYNAPSE_RESPONSE_COMMAND_TTL` | `2m` | API-issued response command lifetime; must be greater than zero and at most `10m`. |
| `SYNAPSE_RESPONSE_EXECUTION_POLL_INTERVAL` | `100ms` | API polling interval for a durable response work-order result; must be greater than zero and at most `1s`. |
| `SYNAPSE_RESPONSE_OBSERVER_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable the independent non-executing process observer. It cannot execute response commands. |
| `SYNAPSE_RESPONSE_OBSERVER_DELAY` | `5s` | Delay before the observer seals its verdict-free readiness report. |
| `SYNAPSE_LEADER_ENABLED` | `false` | Fence scheduled dispatch to one node via a Postgres lease. |
| `SYNAPSE_LEADER_RESOURCE` | `scheduler` | Lease name. |
| `SYNAPSE_LEADER_TERM` | `15s` | Lease term. |
| `SYNAPSE_LEADER_RENEW` | `5s` | Renew interval. |
| `SYNAPSE_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` | `1` | Durable queue claim loops per `synapse-worker` process; must be from 1 through 64. Jobs remain active on every worker, while maintenance sweepers are leader-gated when election is enabled. |
| `SYNAPSE_WORKER_PROFILE` | `all` | `all` initializes hardened scanner handlers, captures ownership source evidence and requires the production sandbox. `integrations` claims only external-integration jobs. `lifecycle` claims Assessment comparison and closure-report jobs and, when ownership is enabled, also dispatches and consumes data-only ownership routing jobs. The two data-only profiles do not construct executable-tool handlers or require sandbox support. |
| `SYNAPSE_INTEGRATION_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` | `false` | Dispatch due external-integration polls. Requires PostgreSQL and `SYNAPSE_LEADER_ENABLED=true`; startup fails closed otherwise. |
| `SYNAPSE_INTEGRATION_SCHEDULER_POLL` | `1m` | Interval for checking enabled integrations whose provider poll is due. |
| `SYNAPSE_INTEGRATION_SCHEDULER_DISPATCH_LIMIT` | `10` | Maximum integration poll operations created per scheduler tick. |
| `SYNAPSE_INTEGRATION_SCHEDULER_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH` | `100` | Stop integration dispatch when the durable queue reaches this aggregate depth. |
| `SYNAPSE_ACCURACY_EVAL_INTERVAL` | `0` (off) | Interval at which the leader worker runs the detection-accuracy regression over the golden corpus and persists a run for the console trend. Zero disables it. |
| `SYNAPSE_INTEGRATION_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK` | `false` | Operator gate allowing tenant administrators to request private-address Jenkins origins. Keep off unless internal egress is explicitly approved; loopback, link-local, metadata, CGNAT, 6to4, and well-known NAT64 ranges remain blocked. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` | `false` | Dispatch due vulnerability-source syncs and recover stale runs. PostgreSQL deployments must also enable leader election. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_SCHEDULER_POLL` | `1m` | Scheduler polling interval. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_SCHEDULER_STALE_AFTER` | `30m` | Age after which a queued/running sync is eligible for checkpoint-based recovery. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_SCHEDULER_JITTER_PERCENT` | `10` | Stable per-source cadence jitter, from 0 through 100 percent. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_SCHEDULER_DISPATCH_LIMIT` | `10` | Maximum new source runs dispatched per scheduler tick. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_SCHEDULER_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH` | `100` | Stop dispatching when the vulnerability-sync queue reaches this depth. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_SCHEDULER_RECOVERY_LIMIT` | `10` | Maximum stale runs recovered per scheduler tick. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_PROVIDER_SYNC_ENABLED` | `false` | Permit provider sync execution. This global gate also blocks already queued runs after rollback. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_INLINE_WORKER_ENABLED` | `false` | Let `synapse-api` consume only vulnerability sync and reconciliation jobs in a PostgreSQL deployment. Intended for an explicit local/single-process topology; leave off when a separate worker consumes those jobs. These data-only handlers execute no target code and do not replace the sandboxed scan worker. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_SYNC_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL` | `0` (off) | Above zero, turns on the leader-gated cadence-driven sync scheduler: every interval one worker enqueues each source whose last successful sync is older than its Cadence and reclaims stranded runs. Needs `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_PROVIDER_SYNC_ENABLED` and `SYNAPSE_LEADER_ENABLED`. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_SYNC_STALE_AFTER` | `2h` | A queued/running sync run older than this is reclaimed by the scheduler's stale-recovery sweep. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_SYNC_SCHEDULER_DISPATCH_LIMIT` | `16` | Maximum syncs enqueued (and stale runs recovered) per scheduler tick. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_SOURCE_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK` | `false` | Permit a vulnerability source to reach RFC1918 addresses. A source is a URL the control plane fetches on a schedule, so leaving this off keeps whoever can write a source from probing the operator's own network. Loopback, link-local and carrier-grade NAT ranges stay blocked either way. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_OCCURRENCE_WRITES_ENABLED` | `false` | Permit tenant-scoped occurrence mutations for allowlisted tenants. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_FINDING_PROJECTION_ENABLED` | `false` | Permit machine-owned finding projection updates for allowlisted tenants. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_ACTIONS_ENABLED` | `false` | Permit risk-change action creation for allowlisted tenants. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` | `false` | Permit notification-outbox writes for allowlisted tenants. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_DRY_RUN_ENABLED` | `true` | Persist reconciliation diffs and counts without occurrence, finding, action, or notification mutations. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_TENANT_ALLOWLIST` | empty | Comma-separated tenant IDs allowed to use tenant-scoped gates and dry-run; `*` enables every tenant. Empty fails closed. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL` | `0` (off) | Leader-gated interval for audited vulnerability retention passes. A positive interval still performs dry-runs unless deletion is separately enabled. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_MAINTENANCE_DELETE_ENABLED` | `false` | Opt in to bounded deletion/clearing of eligible data. Requires a positive maintenance interval and a database role with global RLS visibility. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_RAW_PAYLOAD_RETENTION` | `720h` | Age for non-current provider raw payload clearing; normalized current evidence is preserved. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_SYNC_RUN_RETENTION` | `4320h` | Age for terminal sync runs that have no observation or revision references. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_RESOLVED_OCCURRENCE_RETENTION` | `2160h` | Age for resolved/withdrawn occurrences with no finding, risk, legal hold, current-inventory, or pending-work reference. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_UNREFERENCED_ADVISORY_RETENTION` | `720h` | Age for rejected/withdrawn advisories that have no aliases, observations, revisions needed by runs, tenant checkpoints, workflows, or pending reconciliation. |
| `SYNAPSE_VULNERABILITY_MAINTENANCE_BATCH_SIZE` | `1000` | Per-category upper bound for one maintenance pass; values above 1000 are rejected. |
| `SYNAPSE_SLA_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable versioned risk-based remediation deadlines, immutable assessment history, human-only lifecycle transitions, and continuous-intelligence reassessment. See [Remediation SLA governance](sla-governance.md). |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_CYCLE_API_ENABLED` | `false` | Atomically create initial Assessment Cycles and enable tenant-scoped lifecycle, Re-test, list, and archive APIs. Create/archive requests require `Idempotency-Key`; archive also requires `If-Match`. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_CYCLE_DUAL_WRITE_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable the independently gated new-Assessment Cycle/root dual-write path after schema readiness and tenant rollout checks. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_CYCLE_DUAL_WRITE_TENANTS` | empty | Comma-separated tenant allowlist for Cycle dual-write; `*` enables all tenants. Required when the dual-write gate is enabled. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_SNAPSHOT_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable immutable Assessment Snapshot generation and reads. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_IDENTITY_COMPARISON_SHADOW_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable finding Identity/Observation and Comparison shadow generation without changing legacy reads. Requires Snapshot generation. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_IDENTITY_COMPARISON_SHADOW_TENANTS` | empty | Comma-separated tenant allowlist for Identity/Observation and Comparison shadow generation; `*` enables all tenants. Required when shadow generation is enabled. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_SNAPSHOT_COMPLETION_ENABLED` | `false` | Require a finalized default Snapshot before Assessment completion for an explicit rollout cohort. Disabled preserves legacy completion behavior. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_SNAPSHOT_COMPLETION_TENANTS` | empty | Comma-separated Snapshot-completion enforcement allowlist; it must be a subset of the lifecycle-read allowlist. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_LIFECYCLE_READ_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable lifecycle read projections after backfill and integrity verification. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_LIFECYCLE_READ_TENANTS` | empty | Comma-separated tenant allowlist for lifecycle reads; must be a subset of the shadow-generation allowlist. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_LIFECYCLE_UI_DEFAULT_ENABLED` | `false` | Make lifecycle UI the default; startup rejects this unless lifecycle reads are enabled. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_LIFECYCLE_UI_DEFAULT_TENANTS` | empty | Comma-separated tenant allowlist for lifecycle UI; must be a subset of the lifecycle-read allowlist. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_CLOSURE_REPORT_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable closure and report paths; requires lifecycle reads, Snapshots, and Identity/Comparison generation. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_MIGRATION_BATCH_SIZE` | `500` | Rows per committed lifecycle migration/backfill batch; maximum `2000`. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_PROCESS_TENANT_JOBS` | `4` | Maximum tenants processed concurrently by one lifecycle runner process; maximum `4`. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_COMPARISON_BACKLOG_WARNING` | `500` | Per-tenant queued/generating Comparison warning threshold; maximum `500`. |
| `SYNAPSE_ASSESSMENT_COMPARISON_BACKLOG_HARD_LIMIT` | `1000` | Per-tenant Comparison rollout gate; must be at least the warning threshold and no more than `1000`. |
| `SYNAPSE_DAST_RATE_PER_SEC` | `5` | DAST crawler request rate. |
| `SYNAPSE_DAST_CONCURRENCY` | `4` | DAST crawler concurrency. |
| `SYNAPSE_DAST_MAX_DEPTH` | `8` | Maximum crawl depth. |
| `SYNAPSE_DAST_MAX_PAGES` | `2000` | Maximum pages crawled. |
| `SYNAPSE_DAST_MAX_WALL_CLOCK` | `30m` | Maximum crawl wall-clock. |
| `SYNAPSE_DAST_HELPER_BIN` | `synapse-dast-helper` | Sandboxed DAST helper binary. |

## Recon and execution sandbox (sandbox required in production)

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_SANDBOX_ENABLED` | `false` | Run tool execution and acquisition in the bubblewrap sandbox. Production requires `true`; if bubblewrap is missing, startup fails closed. Kernel egress enforcement additionally needs `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` on the host: the sandbox namespace reaches the network over a veth, and with forwarding off the kernel drops every packet leaving it, so a destination the policy allows is as unreachable as one it denies. The egress probe refuses rather than enabling enforcement that blocks everything. |
| `SYNAPSE_SANDBOX_MEM_MAX` | `536870912` | Per-run memory limit in bytes. |
| `SYNAPSE_SANDBOX_PIDS_MAX` | `256` | Per-run pid limit. |
| `SYNAPSE_TOOL_HASHES` | (TOFU) | Authoritative sha256 pins. The sandbox refuses a binary whose hash does not match. |
| `SYNAPSE_RECON_TIMEOUT` | `3m` | Per-run recon timeout. |
| `SYNAPSE_RECON_CONCURRENCY` | `3` | Recon worker pool size. |
| `SYNAPSE_RECON_ALLOW_CAPABILITY_SENSITIVE` | `false` | Permit tools that need raw sockets. |
| `SYNAPSE_TOOL_EXECUTION_MODE` | (role default) | Explicit process execution posture: `dispatch-only`, `worker`, or `in-process`. Production `synapse-api` defaults to `dispatch-only` and refuses `in-process`, so untrusted tools run only on `synapse-worker`; `dispatch-only` requires PostgreSQL. Leave unset unless overriding the role default. |
| `SYNAPSE_RECON_VIA_WORKER` | `false` | Route recon through the durable queue to synapse-worker. Requires PostgreSQL. |

## Signed egress grants (native worker tier)

Scoped network access for an untrusted process is authorized by the control plane, not by the
worker. The API signs a short-lived grant bound to the exact process and namespace; a root-owned
broker verifies it and configures that namespace before the sandboxed child is released. The
signing seed stays in the control plane and the broker holds only the public verification key. See
[Deployment](deployment.md) and [Security](security.md).

Set the issuer variables on `synapse-api` and the client variables on `synapse-worker`.

| `SYNAPSE_EGRESS_GRANT_AUTHORITY_ADDR` | (none) | API: listen address for the machine-only grant listener, for example `:8082`. Publish it through a private TLS load balancer reachable only from the worker security group, never through the browser ingress. |
| `SYNAPSE_EGRESS_GRANT_ISSUER_TOKEN` | (none) | API: bearer credential the worker machine identity presents to the grant listener. Keep it distinct from `SYNAPSE_API_TOKEN` so a worker holds no human API authority. Never logged. |
| `SYNAPSE_EGRESS_GRANT_SIGNING_SEED` | (none) | API: Ed25519 seed that signs grants. Rotate in two phases so in-flight grants stay verifiable. Never logged. |
| `SYNAPSE_EGRESS_GRANT_AUTHORITY_URL` | (none) | Worker: private HTTPS URL of the grant listener. |
| `SYNAPSE_EGRESS_GRANT_AUTHORITY_TOKEN` | (none) | Worker: machine bearer credential for the grant listener. Never logged. |
| `SYNAPSE_EGRESS_BROKER_SOCKET` | (none) | Worker: path to the root-owned broker's Unix socket. The protocol carries only a run id and canonical CIDR/port rules; it has no command or argv field. |

## AI agent orchestration (off by default)

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_ENABLED` | `false` | Turn on the agent orchestrator. |
| `SYNAPSE_LLM_BASE_URL` | (none) | OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint. |
| `SYNAPSE_LLM_API_KEY` | (none) | Provider key. Never logged. |
| `SYNAPSE_LLM_PROVIDER` | `openai-compatible` | Explicit provider identity retained for audit and separation-of-duties checks. |
| `SYNAPSE_LLM_MODEL` | (none) | Required when the agent is enabled. |
| `SYNAPSE_LLM_TIMEOUT` | `60s` | Per-request timeout. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_APPROVAL_MODE` | `manual` | Human-in-the-loop approval: manual, filter, or auto. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT` | `30m` | Fail-closed approval timeout. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_MAX_STEPS` | `16` | Per-run step bound. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_TOKEN_BUDGET` | `0` | 0 means unbounded. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_MAX_DURATION` | `10m` | Per-run duration bound. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_VIA_WORKER` | `false` | Durable agent on synapse-worker. Requires the recon worker and PostgreSQL. |

## AI analysis brain (opt-in, best-effort)

`SYNAPSE_JUDGMENTS_ENABLED` (on by default) is the prerequisite for the analyzers that mint judgments.
All are best-effort and no-op without inputs. Set a flag to `false` to opt out.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_JUDGMENTS_ENABLED` | `true` | Judgment lifecycle routes (verify, accept, list). |
| `SYNAPSE_SAST_ENABLED` | `true` | Pattern SAST in the scan pipeline. |
| `SYNAPSE_REACHABILITY_ENABLED` | `true` | Call-graph reachability proof (Go, Tier-2). Needs judgments. |
| `SYNAPSE_REACHABILITY_BUILDER` | `owned` | Reachability call-graph producer: `owned` (go/ssa, default) or `govulncheck`. |
| `SYNAPSE_PYREACH_ENABLED` | `true` | Python import-reachability (Tier-1 direct dead-dependency → OpenVEX). Default ON. Needs judgments. |
| `SYNAPSE_PYREACH_TIER2_ENABLED` | `false` | Python semantic call-graph reachability (Tier-2). Requires Python Tier-1 and `synapse-ast`. |
| `SYNAPSE_TAINT_ENABLED` | `false` | Go call-graph taint proposals. Needs judgments and the target-compilation sandbox. |
| `SYNAPSE_PYTAINT_ENABLED` | `true` | Python value-flow taint proposals (default-on when synapse-ast resolves). Needs judgments and `synapse-ast`; source-only, so the sandbox is optional. |
| `SYNAPSE_JSTAINT_ENABLED` | `false` | JavaScript/TypeScript value-flow taint proposals (OFF by default). Needs judgments and `synapse-ast`; source-only, so the sandbox is optional. |
| `SYNAPSE_JAVATAINT_ENABLED` | `false` | Java value-flow taint proposals (OFF by default). Needs judgments and `synapse-ast`; source-only, so the sandbox is optional. |
| `SYNAPSE_TAINT_RULES_FILE` | empty | Optional YAML file of custom Python and JavaScript taint rules (`python.sources` / `python.sinks` and `js.sources` / `js.sinks`) merged additively into the built-in catalogs at startup. A custom source/sink is import-anchored (`modules` + `names`); a sink also names a taint `class`, a `cwe`, a `rule` id, and a zero-based `argument`. Custom rules only ADD detection (a new source or sink); there are no custom sanitizers, so they cannot suppress a built-in flow. A malformed or invalid file fails startup rather than silently dropping rules. |
| `SYNAPSE_CROSSCHECK_ENABLED` | `true` | Detection-source disagreement judgments. |
| `SYNAPSE_SBOM_CROSSCHECK_ENABLED` | `false` | Dual-producer SBOM cross-check: a second producer runs beside the primary and components only one emits become ungated judgments for review. Opt-in, because the owned parsers are the primary producer and the only second producer is Syft, so enabling it makes the deployment depend on a Syft binary. |
| `SYNAPSE_GOMODGRAPH_ENABLED` | `true` | Transitive Go dependency edges via `go mod graph`. |
| `SYNAPSE_WRITEUP_DRAFTS_ENABLED` | `false` | Agent write-up draft tool. A distinct human signs off. |

## Additional operator settings

The settings below are intentionally grouped by owning process. They are real operator controls even
when they are used only by a CLI, helper, or optional subsystem.

### Database, project storage, and maintenance

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_DB_MIGRATION_DSN` | `SYNAPSE_DB_DSN` | Optional owner-level PostgreSQL DSN used only for embedded migrations. Use it to keep the runtime DSN least-privileged. |
| `SYNAPSE_PROJECT_UPLOAD_DIR` | `data/project-uploads` | Server-owned directory for uploaded project source bundles. |
| `SYNAPSE_PROJECT_ANALYSIS_COMPLETION_TIMEOUT` | `1m` | Maximum wait for project-analysis completion; non-positive values reset to one minute. |
| `SYNAPSE_APPROVAL_SWEEP_INTERVAL` | `1m` | Sweep interval for expired pending approvals. |
| `SYNAPSE_PROMOTION_RECONCILE_INTERVAL` | `1m` | Interval for deterministic promotion-rule reevaluation. |

### Advisory, NVD, and resolver access

Network-backed manifest resolution is disabled by default. When enabled, set the associated host
allowlist; an empty or overly broad allowlist must not become an implicit network policy.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_NVD_API_URL` | public NVD API | NVD API endpoint override for an approved mirror. |
| `SYNAPSE_NVD_API_KEY` | empty | NVD API key. Keep it in the process environment or secret manager; never put it in source. |
| `SYNAPSE_NVD_BUDGET` | `20s` | Per-request NVD enrichment budget. |
| `SYNAPSE_NVD_CVSS_DB` | empty | CLI path to an offline CVSS database built with `build-cvss-db`. |
| `SYNAPSE_MAVEN_RESOLVE_ENABLED` | `false` | Resolve Maven metadata from allowlisted repositories. |
| `SYNAPSE_MAVEN_REPO_HOSTS` | empty | Comma-separated Maven host allowlist. |
| `SYNAPSE_MAVEN_LOCAL_REPO` | platform default | Local Maven repository override. |
| `SYNAPSE_GRADLE_RESOLVE_ENABLED` | `false` | Resolve Gradle metadata. Requires an isolated Gradle home and approved hosts. |
| `SYNAPSE_GRADLE_HOME` | empty | Isolated Gradle user-home directory. |
| `SYNAPSE_GRADLE_HTTP_TIMEOUT_MS` | implementation default | Gradle HTTP timeout in milliseconds. |
| `SYNAPSE_NPM_RESOLVE_ENABLED` | `false` | Resolve npm manifests from allowlisted registries. |
| `SYNAPSE_NPM_REGISTRY_HOSTS` | empty | Comma-separated npm registry host allowlist. |
| `SYNAPSE_MANIFEST_RESOLVE_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable remaining external manifest resolvers. |
| `SYNAPSE_BUNDLER_RESOLVE_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable the Ruby Bundler resolver. Opt-in everywhere (incl. the CLI) because `bundle lock` evaluates the Gemfile as Ruby, i.e. runs project code; run sandbox-confined in production. |
| `SYNAPSE_MANIFEST_REGISTRY_HOSTS` | empty | Comma-separated host allowlist for those resolvers. |
| `SYNAPSE_JARHASH_BASE_URL` | empty | Approved jar-hash service or mirror URL. |
| `SYNAPSE_JARHASH_DB_PATH` | empty | Offline jar-hash database path. |

Tool binary overrides use `SYNAPSE_AST_BIN`, `SYNAPSE_GOVULNCHECK_BIN`, `SYNAPSE_GO_BIN`,
`SYNAPSE_MVN_BIN`, `SYNAPSE_GRADLE_BIN`, `SYNAPSE_NPM_BIN`, `SYNAPSE_COMPOSER_BIN`,
`SYNAPSE_BUNDLE_BIN`, `SYNAPSE_POETRY_BIN`, and `SYNAPSE_TAINT_CALLGRAPH_BIN`. Defaults are the
corresponding command names on `PATH`; production sandbox deployments should use absolute, pinned paths.

### Recon and DAST limits

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_RECON_MAX_OUTPUT` | `8388608` | Maximum captured output per recon run, in bytes. |
| `SYNAPSE_RECON_QUEUE` | `64` | Recon work queue depth. |
| `SYNAPSE_DAST_MAX_REAUTH` | `2` | Maximum governed reauthorization cycles for a DAST session. |
| `SYNAPSE_DAST_MAX_REQUESTS` | `20000` | Hard request ceiling for a DAST session. |
| `SYNAPSE_DAST_SECRET_<NAME>` | unset | Helper-only projection of a named vault placeholder. The parent constructs and scrubs these values; operators should store the source secret in the vault instead of setting this prefix manually. |

`SYNAPSE_DAST_AUTH_REQUEST_FD`, `SYNAPSE_DAST_AUTH_DECISION_FD`,
`SYNAPSE_CSPM_CREDENTIAL_FD`, `SYNAPSE_CSPM_AUTH_REQUEST_FD`, and
`SYNAPSE_CSPM_AUTH_DECISION_FD` are inherited-pipe descriptors managed by the parent process. They are
not operator settings and must not be injected manually.

### Fleet control plane

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CA_KEY` | empty | Private key for the fleet client-certificate CA. Required with the fleet CA certificate; treat as a production secret. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CERT_TTL` | `24h` | Lifetime of issued fleet client certificates. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CLIENT_CERT_HEADER` | empty | Trusted reverse-proxy header carrying the verified client certificate. Enable only behind a proxy that strips all client-supplied copies and sets the header after mTLS verification. Required when fleet is enabled in production. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_CLIENT_CERT_HOST` | empty | Dedicated mTLS virtual host for post-enrollment fleet transport. Required and distinct from the enrollment host in production. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_ENROLLMENT_HOST` | empty | Dedicated TLS-only virtual host for one-time bearer enrollment. Required and distinct from the mTLS host in production. |
| `SYNAPSE_UPDATE_PUBLIC_KEY` | built-in release key | Hex Ed25519 public-key override for fleet self-update verification. Use only for a controlled private release channel. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_CONCURRENCY` | `8` | Total server-side agent work concurrency. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_QUEUE_DEPTH` | `256` | Pending agent-work queue depth. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_MAX_PARALLEL` | `1` | Maximum parallel actions per agent; serial by default. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_RECON_CONCURRENCY` | `3` | Recon work admitted within the agent budget. |

### Host and Kubernetes agents

The following variables are read by `synapse-agent` and `synapse-cluster-agent`, not by the API:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_URL` | empty | Fleet API base URL. HTTPS is required except for loopback development. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_ENROL_TOKEN` | empty | One-time enrollment token. Environment use is supported, but a token file is preferred; the equivalent command-line flag is visible in process listings and shell history. |
| `SYNAPSE_FLEET_ENROL_TOKEN_FILE` | empty | Preferred file containing the one-time token. Remove it after successful enrollment. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_STATE_DIR` | platform default | Credential and offline-buffer directory; `/var/lib/synapse-cluster-agent` for the cluster agent. Protect it from other users. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_ROOT` | `/` | Host filesystem root inventoried by the VM agent. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_NAME` | hostname | Human-readable agent display name. |
| `SYNAPSE_INVENTORY_SWEEP_ENABLED` | `true` | Ship host inventory continuously on a cadence (A8, #629), not only on a `scan.host` work order. Ingest is idempotent server-side (host upsert-by-natural-key), so a re-sweep of an unchanged host is a no-op. Set `false` to disable. |
| `SYNAPSE_INVENTORY_SWEEP_INTERVAL` | `1h` | Cadence of the continuous host-inventory sweep. Clamped to a 1-minute floor so a misconfiguration cannot busy-loop the collector over the filesystem. |
| `SYNAPSE_RUNTIME_REACHABILITY_ENABLED` | `true` | Ship runtime-reachability evidence (#1060/#1061): the shared libraries observed loading via eBPF, joined to their owning OS packages, so a finding on an actually-loaded package is raised over one that is only installed. Linux with the eBPF library-load sensor only; on other hosts the agent ships a single coverage-gap report and stops. Set `false` to disable. |
| `SYNAPSE_RUNTIME_REACHABILITY_INTERVAL` | `5m` | Cadence of the runtime-reachability evidence ship. Clamped to a 1-minute floor so a misconfiguration cannot busy-loop the package-database read. |
| `SYNAPSE_PROCESS_REPORT_ENABLED` | `true` | Report the host's running processes to the behavior baseline (#594 D) on the inventory-sweep cadence. Read-only procfs metadata (pid, comm, exe path); no process memory is read and nothing is executed. Set `false` to disable. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_PROC_ROOT` | `/proc` | Procfs root the agent enumerates running processes from. A host without procfs reports nothing. |
| `SYNAPSE_DETECT_CLASSES` | empty | Comma-separated eBPF classes: `process`, `network`, `file`, `privilege`. Empty disables the engine; Linux root/capabilities are required. |
| `SYNAPSE_DETECT_CPU_CEIL_PCT` | `0` | CPU ceiling for deterministic class shedding; zero disables shedding. |
| `SYNAPSE_DETECTION_ENGAGEMENT_ID` | empty | Engagement receiving signed detection batches. Empty keeps confirmed detections durably local and does not start the remote detection shipper. |
| `SYNAPSE_DETECTION_SHIP_INTERVAL` | `1s` | Poll interval while the independent P1 detection delivery lane is empty. Network/429/5xx retry uses separate capped exponential backoff. |
| `SYNAPSE_TELEMETRY_SPOOL_BYTES` | `536870912` | Maximum bytes of checksummed telemetry WAL segments (minimum 1 MiB). P3 is evicted first with durable gap evidence; P0–P2 backpressure instead of shedding. |
| `SYNAPSE_AGENT_METRICS_ADDR` | empty | Optional private Prometheus listener for agent spool metrics. It has no authentication; bind to loopback or a protected scrape network. |
| `SYNAPSE_CLUSTER` | empty (required) | Stable cluster identity attached to every Kubernetes asset. |
| `SYNAPSE_CLUSTER_NAMESPACES` | empty | Comma-separated namespace scope; empty means all authorized namespaces. |
| `SYNAPSE_CLUSTER_RESYNC` | `5m` | Interval between Kubernetes inventory collections. |

### CLI integration

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_API_URL` | empty | Server base URL used by `synapse-cli publish-source`; overridden by `--server`. |
| `SYNAPSE_DECORATION_TOKEN` | (none) | Forge write token for `synapse-cli gate --decorate`. Scoped to the CI provider's forge (a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket token with permission to write commit statuses, checks/reports, and PR/MR comments). Prefer a short-lived CI-provided token. Never logged, and never needed for `--dry-run`. |
| `SYNAPSE_DECORATION_USERNAME` | empty | Username paired with `SYNAPSE_DECORATION_TOKEN` for Bitbucket Basic auth. Leave empty for GitHub/GitLab and for Bitbucket access tokens (defaults to `x-token-auth`). |
| `SYNAPSE_REACH_RUST` | `true` | Conservative Rust manifest/import reachability (Tier-1). Default ON; fails to unknown on any coverage gap. Needs judgments. |
| `SYNAPSE_REACH_RUBY` | `true` | Conservative Ruby manifest/import reachability (Tier-1). Default ON; fails to unknown on any coverage gap. Needs judgments. |
| `SYNAPSE_REACH_PHP` | `true` | Conservative PHP manifest/import reachability (Tier-1). Default ON; fails to unknown on any coverage gap. Needs judgments. |
| `SYNAPSE_REACH_DOTNET` | `true` | Build-aware .NET (C#/VB) dead-dependency reachability (Tier-1). Reads each direct NuGet package's REAL exported namespaces from its restored assemblies (`project.assets.json` + the on-disk assembly cache), not a guess from the package id, so `AWSSDK.S3` (namespace `Amazon.S3`) is matched correctly. Concludes `not_affected` only when a direct dependency's full namespace set is known and none of it is referenced in first-party source. Reads bytes only, runs nothing. Fails closed to unknown (mints nothing) on any gap: a reflection/`dynamic` construct, no restore graph (build the project first), an unreadable/forwarder-bearing assembly, or a transitive subject. Needs judgments. |
| `SYNAPSE_REACH_GOBIN` | `true` | RAISE-ONLY Go-binary affected-symbol reachability (Tier-2). For a Linux/amd64 Go process image, a rooted direct-call path from `main.main` to an affected function can raise the finding only when its exact module and version agree across the advisory, current SBOM, and that binary's build info. Supported inlining metadata can also prove a call. Missing or ambiguous metadata, unsupported binaries, and unresolved indirect calls provide no coverage. It never concludes `not_reachable` or OpenVEX `not_affected`. Reads binaries only, builds nothing. Needs judgments. |
| `SYNAPSE_REACH_CPP` | `true` | Source-only, RAISE-ONLY C/C++ (Conan) affected-symbol reachability (Tier-2). First-party source that references a curated vulnerable function by its scope-qualified name (`ns::Class::method(`, `new ns::Class(`) raises that finding's urgency. It NEVER concludes `not_reachable` (macros, function pointers, `dlopen`/`dlsym`, textual `#include`, LTO/inlining, and mangling all hide calls), so it can only raise, never suppress, and its verdict never becomes an OpenVEX `not_affected`. Reads source bytes only, builds nothing. Needs judgments. |

## MCP server (synapse-mcp)

Read and propose only. It never executes. The token and engagement ID are required to start it.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SYNAPSE_MCP_TOKEN` | (none) | Bearer token. Never logged. |
| `SYNAPSE_MCP_ENGAGEMENT_ID` | (none) | The engagement the MCP server is scoped to. |
| `SYNAPSE_MCP_ADDR` | `:8081` | Listen address. |
